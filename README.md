## Learning Git üòÅ
I learned about Git and Github, which i already know but forgot due to not using lately.
The resources i used are the YT vieo provided by the FreeCodeCamp.
Now I have volunteer work, need to learn bash and do the Light Dose task first.

## Terminal Commands 
I learned Bash Script from the tutorial from FreecodeCamp yt video and to clear some doubt arise from that i watched a beginner video on linux cmd.
Now i uncderstand that Bash(Bourne Again SHell) is command-line interpreter widely used in LinuX for many years.
cmd used are:
  * touch - to create a new file
  * cd - to go into a directory
  * mkdir - to make a directory
  * mv - to move/rename file
  * echo - to display the string/variable
  * find - to find files.
  * cat - to view content of the file
  * grep - used to search for specific patterns or regular expressions
  * wc - used to count number of words, lines, bytes..
  * top - monitor system processer in real-time
  * sudo - enable user to perform administrative task.

## Bash Scripting
I am using VScode for editing and making the code as it is easy to use.
We can use vscode using the command ' code filename.type '
In this task i have to write a Bash script.

I faced challenges in doing simple task because i am not that much familiar with bash still.
Therefor I used help from GeeksforGeeks and Stackoverflow. Both for getting new function and understand what it do.
I also came to know that unlike C space has some meaning in Bash, I was getting some error due to i add space when assigning variable.
