# Mars_Task_1

### Learning Git üòÅ
I learned about Git and Github, which i already know but forgot due to not using lately.
The resources i used are the YT vieo provided by the FreeCodeCamp.

## Light Dose

### Terminal Commands 
I learned Bash Script from the tutorial from FreecodeCamp yt video and to clear some doubt arise from that i watched a beginner video on linux cmd.
Now i uncderstand that Bash(Bourne Again SHell) is command-line interpreter widely used in LinuX for many years.
cmd used are:
  * touch - to create a new file
  * cd - to go into a directory
  * mkdir - to make a directory
  * mv - to move/rename file
  * echo - to display the string/variable
  * find - to find files.
  * cat - to view content of the file
  * grep - used to search for specific patterns or regular expressions
  * wc - used to count number of words, lines, bytes..
  * top - monitor system processer in real-time
  * sudo - enable user to perform administrative task.

### Bash Scripting
I am using VScode for editing and making the code as it is easy to use.
We can use vscode using the command ' code filename.type '
In this task i have to write a Bash script.

I faced challenges in doing simple task because i am not that much familiar with bash still.
Therefor I used help from GeeksforGeeks and Stackoverflow. Both for getting new function and understand what it do.
I also came to know that unlike C space has some meaning in Bash, I was getting some error due to i add space when assigning variable.

## Medium Dose

### 1.Detect Red Circle and make a 360 turn

### 2.Morse Code to English translator
Morse code is a system which represent letters and numbers in Dot and Dash format.
It has both military and Scientific uses to send and recieve long distance message using radios, sound, light .....
We have different type of Morse code, but the one I implemented is Internation Morse Code.

I faced some challenges when trying to code in C to effectively implement a dictionary type data structure, therefore i used python for this.

### 3.Decode Encrypted Message
The task is to decode a encrypted message using logic.
I have implemented the code to decode the the message.
The program take encrypted message as input and print decoded message.

This task wasn't really a challenge, but a mistake some will miss is the case when char goes below 'A'. otherwise it's a easy one.
Now with this profound knowledge i can send secret code to my friends.

### 4.Martian Filter to remove noise.
Muchiko Filter (Mean Filter) and Sanchiko Filter(Median Filter) is used to remove the noise.
Muchiko Filter is weak, when filtering Noise. Bcz just one extreme value can skew the mean.
Sanchiko is likely give a stable reading bcz it ignores extreme value.
But My choice is Hybrid, bcz it will give more smooth reading than Sanchiko keeping the property of it.

### 5.Convert Euler angle to Quaternion system.
Many Software for 3d modeling uses Euler Angle bcz it's easy to understand.
but it comes with disadvantages like Gimbal lock and Interpolation issue.
Gimbal lock occur when two rotational axes in 3-angle align, causing the loss of one DOF.
To overcome this, we have different system invloving imaginary numbers calles Quaternions.

This program convert given Euler angle to Quaternion system.
```math
w = \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)
```

```math
x = \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)
```

```math
y = \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)
```

```math
z = \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right) - \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)
```
*Where:*
- $\phi$ = Roll (rotation about X-axis)
- $\theta$ = Pitch (rotation about Y-axis)
- $\psi$ = Yaw (rotation about Z-axis)

## Hard Dose

### 1.Brick_Map Creation
The task consisted of some co-ordinate relative to starting point where some obstacles are present.
The task demanded the knowldege of File handling and matrix manipulation.
The task was relatively simple.
there is a bonus question to find Shortest Path, which i will do it later.

## Bonus
The bonus question was to find the Shortest distance from a point to another point.
due to my luck, i guess, sir was teaching BFS topic and graph theory in discreet and DSA.
therefore finding the answer was simple, but implementiong was tough i say.
Now i started to understand why a BUG will ruin your entire day, just like we saw in reels.
my mistakes was so minute but devastating for me.
