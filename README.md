# Mars_Task_1

## Learning Git 😁
I learned about Git and Github, which i already know but forgot due to not using lately.
The resources i used are the YT vieo provided by the FreeCodeCamp.
Now I have volunteer work, need to learn bash and do the Light Dose task first.

## BASH script 
I learned Bash Script from the tutorial from FreecodeCamp yt video and to clear some doubt arise from that i watched a beginner video on linux cmd.

Now i uncderstand that Bash(Bourne Again SHell) is command-line interpreter widely used in LinuX for many years.
